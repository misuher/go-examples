This is an ajax example using jquery. I create two text area, all that you write in one of them appears in the other updated by an ajax procedure. 
This example can be running as a golang server, just clone the repo and type:

		cd ajax
		go run main.go

and you can access it in localhost:3000, in this way you can also see the server logs in real time where I send just all you type in a box
